        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I like Jimmy John's and Jersey Mike's subs, but I don't like the preservatives they use in most (if not all) of their ingredients. So if you
        want to eat Italian subs for dayzzz (and trust me, you will after trying this recipe), stock up on ingredients and you'll end up saving a hell of
        a lot of money (think $2.50 per sub instead of $8-10). Grab a bag of chips (I like jalapeno or salt & vinegar), wash it all down with a sparkling citrus
        flavored water, and whip up a batch of homemade chewy chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Blam! Jimmy John's at home.</p>
