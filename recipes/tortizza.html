        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The tortizza is one idea in a seemingly endless pool of options to pick from for a quick lunch or weeknight dinner.
        For me, it epitomizes low-effort, high-reward cooking on those days when a big dinner project is just not going to happen.
        The end result is a crispy, thin-crust tavern-style pie that rivals some of the artisinal Midwest pizzerias' products at a
        fraction of the price -- and in hardly no time at all.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stacey's Organic 10" Wheat Flour Tortillas</li>
            <li>Muir Glen Organic Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>Whole Milk Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            <li>Monterey Jack Cheese</li>
            <li>Pizza Toppings of Choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to around 425°F (ovens vary, so you could really go +/-25° and adapt from there).</li>
            <li>Grab a flour tortilla and splash a bit of olive oil (1-2 tsp) on each side, gently rubbing it in for even coverage.</li>
            <li>Pull your Muir Glen Organic Pizza Sauce out of the cupboard, crack it open, and spread a thin layer of sauce over the tortilla,
            leaving a half-inch unsauced border for the crust. You can season the sauce at this point with some crushed chili flakes, fennel seeds and dried oregano.</li>
            <li>Using a box grater placed over a bowl, coarsely shred around three parts Mozzarella to one part Monterey Jack and mix together.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle shredded cheese over the sauce until covered, then dot with your favorite toppings and a drizzle of olive oil. If using sausage, please par-fry it first!</li>
        </ol>
