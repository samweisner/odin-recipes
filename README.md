# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website from TOP Foundations course
In this project, I built a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The website doesn't look very pretty, but this project only exists to build my HTML chops; I will revisit it in the future to style everything up with CSS.
